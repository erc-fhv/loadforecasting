## Reusing only the Forecasting Models

Our forecasting models can be easily reused in other applications as shown below.

1. Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/erc-fhv/loadforecasting.git
    ```

2. Use in Python:
    ```python
    from models import Model
    import torch 


    # Train the sequence-to-sequence model
    #

    X_train = torch.randn(365, 24, 10)  # Your train features of shape (batch_len, sequence_len, features)
    Y_train = torch.randn(365, 24, 1)  # Your train target of shape (batch_len, sequence_len, 1)
    myModel = Model('Transformer', model_size='5k', num_of_features=X_train.shape[2])   # Alternative Models: 'LSTM', 'xLSTM', 'KNN'
    myModel.train_model(X_train, Y_train, pretrain_now=False, finetune_now=False, epochs=100, verbose=0)


    # Predict
    #

    X_test = torch.randn(90, 24, 10)  # Your test features of shape (batch_len, sequence_len, features)
    Y_pred = myModel.predict(X_test)
    print('\nOutput Shape = ', Y_pred.shape)

    ```

## Reproduce the Complete Paper

The entire paper can be reproduced by following these steps.

1. Set up the environment (Linux only):
    ```bash
    conda env create --name load_forecasting --file=envs/env_linux.yml
    conda activate load_forecasting
    ```

2. Train the models:
    ```bash
    python scripts/ModelTrainer.py
    ```

3. Generate figures and tables:

    Open and run either 
    ```
    scripts/Paper_Illustration.ipynb
    ```
    or    
    ```
    scripts/Model_Evaluation.ipynb
    ```
